# Introduction
This is just a simple flask web API to simulate the shopping store website, and help me to understand the request and response process.

1. Using the @app.router() to handle the endpoint
2. Define a function to process the request 
3. Send response back to the client

This simple API using JSON to transmit data:

1. It is must be a dictionary to be jsonified
2. JSON is well defined string to format data and transmit it.
